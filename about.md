### Welcome to the Competitive Programming Handbook by the Programming Club of KNIT Sultanpur! 🚀💻

We are a group of passionate coders and problem solvers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of algorithmic thinking and nurturing a thriving coding culture at our institution.

# 👩‍💻 Who We Are

The Programming and Tech Skill Club at KNIT Sultanpur is a vibrant community of students who share a common love for programming and technology. Our club brings together individuals across all skill levels—whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder—to explore the world of competitive programming, data structures, algorithms, and beyond. Through regular coding contests, hackathons, workshops, and peer-to-peer learning, we aim to cultivate problem-solving skills that are essential for success in the tech world.

# 🎯 Our Mission

Our primary goal is to:

- Encourage collaborative learning. 🤝
- Foster a competitive programming culture. 🏆
- Equip students with the skills needed to excel in coding competitions and technical interviews. 💼
- Make the world of algorithms and data structures accessible to everyone. 📘

This handbook is one of our initiatives to achieve this mission, offering a comprehensive guide for both newcomers and advanced coders.

# 📚 What is the Handbook?

The **Competitive Programming Handbook** is a curated resource designed to provide KNIT Sultanpur students and the wider programming community with a structured pathway to mastering competitive coding. Covering essential topics from basic algorithms to complex problem-solving strategies, the handbook serves as both a learning guide and a reference tool.

**The handbook includes**:

- **Core algorithms and data structures** explained in a simple and practical manner. 🧠
- **Problem-solving techniques** drawn from real competitive programming contests. ⚡
- Set of **practice problems** in each module to reinforce learning. 📝
- **Illustrative examples** to enhance understanding. 🌟
- A compilation of **useful resources** for further learning. 🔗

# ❓ Why This Handbook?

We created this handbook to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving. Whether you’re preparing for coding competitions like Codeforces, CodeChef, or LeetCode, or brushing up on algorithms for job interviews, this handbook is your go-to resource.

We believe that everyone, regardless of their starting point, can excel in competitive programming with the right guidance and practice. This handbook is a step in that direction. 💪

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This handbook is the result of the hard work and collaboration of many talented individuals from the Programming Club of KNIT Sultanpur. Each contributor has played a vital role in creating the modules, sharing their expertise, and building this valuable resource for the community. We are immensely grateful for their efforts and dedication.
