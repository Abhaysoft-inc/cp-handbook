## INTRODUCTION

Letâ€™s understand the concept of arrays using an analogy. Consider a situation in which we have 20 students in a class and we have been asked to write a program that reads and prints the marks of all the 20 students. In this program, we will need 20 integer variables with different names.
Now to read the values of these 20 variables, we must have 20 read statements. Similarly, to print the value of these variables, we need 20 write statements. If it is just a matter of 20 variables, then it might be acceptable for the user to follow this approach. But would it be possible to follow this approach if we have to read and print the marks of students,
in the entire course (say 100 students),
in the entire college (say 500 students),
in the entire university (say 10,000 students).
The answer is no, definitely not! To process a large amount of data, we need a data structure known as an array.

## ARRAY

Array can be defined as **a collection of similar data types that are stored at contiguous memory locations**.

![Array](/assets/images/array.png)

### Array Declaration

Declaring an array means specifying the following:

- Data type - the kind of values it can store, for example, int, char, float, double.
- Name - to identify the array.
- Size - the maximum number of values that the array can hold.

Array can be declared using the following syntax:

`data_type name[size]`;

```cpp
int arr[8];
```

## Memory Representation of Array

Consider the following array declaration:

```cpp
int arr[8];
```

When we make this declaration, 32 bytes are immediately reserved in memory: 4 bytes for each of the 8 integers (which can vary depending on the operating system). Since the array is not being initialized, all eight values within it would be garbage values. This occurs because the storage class of this array is assumed to be 'auto'. However, if the storage class is declared as 'static', then all the array elements would have a default initial value of zero. Regardless of the initial values, all the array elements would always be located in contiguous memory locations.
This arrangement of array elements in memory is shown in the figure below.

## Storing Values in Array

There are three ways to store values in an array, as mentioned in the figure below:

![storing values in array](/assets/images/storing-values-in-arr.png)

### 1. Initializing Arrays during Declaration:

The elements of an array can be initialized at the time of declaration, just as any other variable. When an array is initialized, we need to provide a value for every element in the array. Arrays are initialized by writing, `data_type array_name[size] = {list of values};`

```cpp
int arr[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0};
```

### 2. Input Values for the Elements from the Keyboard:

An array can be initialized by inputting values from the keyboard. In this method, a loop is executed to input the value for each element of the array. For example,

```cpp
int marks[10];
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    cin >> marks[i];
}
```

### 3. Assigning Values to Individual Elements:

The third way is to assign values to individual elements of the array by using the assignment operator. Any value that evaluates to the data type as that of the array can be assigned to the individual array element. A simple assignment statement can be written as,

```cpp
int arr[1] = 10;
int arr[2] = 20;
```

## Operations On Array:

There are a number of operations that can be performed on arrays. These operations include:

- **Traversal**: Accessing each and every element of the array.
- **Insertion**: Inserting a new element in an array.
- **Deletion**: Deleting element from the array.
- **Searching**:  Search for an element in the array.
- **Sorting**: Maintaining the order of elements in the array.

Let's delve into the operations of an array using an example. Suppose we need to create a program that takes the marks of n students in a class and finds the highest mark among them, assuming that the marks are given in the order of increasing roll numbers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of students: ";
    cin >> n;

    // Declare arrays to store marks of n students
    int marks[n];

    // Prompt the user to enter marks
    cout << "Enter the marks and roll numbers of " << n << " students:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> marks[i];
    }

    // Initialize highestMark with the first student's marks
    int highestMark = marks[0];
    int highestRoll = 0;

    // Iterate through the array to find the highest mark
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Check if the current mark is higher than highestMark
        if (marks[i] > highestMark) {
            // Update highestMark if a higher mark is found
            highestMark = marks[i];
            highestRoll = i;
        }
    }

    // Display the highest mark among the students and the roll number of the highest scorer
    cout << "The highest mark among the students is: " << highestMark << endl;
    // Note: Index of array starts with zero, that is why we are adding 1 to highestRoll
    cout << "The roll number of the highest scorer is: " << (highestRoll+1) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
